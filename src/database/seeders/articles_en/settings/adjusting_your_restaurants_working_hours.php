            Using the control panel, you can easily set up your restaurant's working days and hours, ensuring that your availability is clearly communicated to your website visitors.

            <p>You can set individual operating schedules for each of your restaurant's servicesâ€” <a>home delivery</a>, <a>order pickup</a>, and <a>dine-in</a>. To configure the working days and hours for each service, simply go to to <b>Settings</b> in the control panel menu and then to a service page.</p>
            <img class="articleImg" src="/storage/imgs/help/articles/.png" />
            <p>After opening any service page, you will find a series of tabs, each containing adjustable settings. Within the <b>Working days</b> tab, you'll find a list that allows you to set and adjust working days and hours.</p>
