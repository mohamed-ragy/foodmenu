                <div class=\"sectionP\">The share tool is used to share products or categories from your restaurant's website on your social media platforms. This can be an effective technique for driving traffic to your website, informing customers about new products, or promoting a specific product category. Regularly sharing your products on social media will build awareness about all the different types of products you have, which can increase the number of items included in your orders and generate leads by capturing the interest of a larger audience. The share tool also simplifies the sharing process by inserting the product description and image directly from your website into your social media posts, allowing you to share your products with just a few clicks.
