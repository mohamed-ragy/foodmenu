This section provides a convenient way to view and manage all orders that need further action to be completed. Orders are classified as incomplete when they require additional steps or processes before they can be considered complete. By having a dedicated area to track these orders, you can ensure efficient handling and timely completion, resulting in a smooth experience for both you and your customers.</div>
                <div class=\"sectionP\">To reach the incomplete order section, go to the <b>Orders</b> section of the control panel menu, then click on <b>Incomplete Orders</b> to open a window with the orders list.</div>
